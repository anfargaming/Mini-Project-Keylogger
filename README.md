# ðŸ”¥Mini-Project-Keylogger
We developed keylogging software in Python3 that records every keystroke of physical as
well as on-screen keyboard, and delivers keylogs through email in response to a timer.
Simple overview of use/purpose.

# What is a KeyLogger ?
A keylogger is a form of malware or hardware that keeps track of and records your keystrokes as you type. It takes the information and sends it to a hacker using a command-and-control (C&C) server. 

# How to prevent Keylogging ? 
1. Use a 2-Step Verification.
2. Install Anti Malware Program.
3. Avoid Downloading Crack Software.
4. Use a Password Manager.

# How to detect Keyloggers
1. Through Task Manager.
2. Full Malware Scan

## Description
Our graphical user interface simply receives input and logs keystrokes in response to a timer. In this project, we used a variety of libraries, including tkinter, pynput.keyboard, logging, time, smtplib, SSL, email, threading, etc.
## Getting Started
* In order to start a Python code, we must install a few packages; to do so, run pip install (package name)
* You can create an app password for our application or find out more information by visiting [ðŸ”—](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) .
* Auto-py-to-exe may be installed to create an executable file for a Python code.
